README:

1. I haven't included a requirement file, since you already have flask. I'm using
pandas apart from flask related modules. In case of issues, please refer to the list
here:
https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world

2. I assuemd that the virtualenv directory "env" is at the same level as the xboard
root directory:
 /xboard
   /data
   /app
     /template
     /static
     ...
   ...
 /env
...

3. How to run this: First run the csv_to_db.py to create the database, app.db. Then
run run.py (see the result at localhost:5000)

4. I haven't included any database migrate/upgrade/downgrade scripts, since for now
I'm just deleting the databases and re-running the csv_to_db script

5. I wrote the User class (incomplete -- many more fields need to be added), and a
parent "Course" class. I think we need to add a class to store the timeseries info. We
might need other classes (problems, chapters?) -- we'll see

6. For now, I have been loading only the "fake_di_data_person_course.csv" into the
database. We need to expand the csv_to_db script to load the other csv files into app.db

7. The "/data" route in views.py looks terrible -- loading x/y arrays via different option
choices should be handled via a function. But perhaps we should introduce POST request
for that anyway and perhaps we'll re-write this section  

8. I want to use Bootstrap down the line to make the frontend look a bit nicer
